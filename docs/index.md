## Some Background Stories

[soDLA](https://github.com/soDLA-publishment/soDLA)  is a NVDLA rewritten in chisel starting from October 2018, beta version released in Dec 2019.

Since open-source project cannot have a long-term development without a commercial company or funding. 
In May 2020, my friend Leo Lin helped to register [NProcessor](https://nprocessor.com/) as a company in Delaware. 

NProcessor's first commercial project is [cora extension](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv5966816).
The initial idea of cora cames from the soDLA proposal that I submitted to Prof. Borivoje in 2018(he thought this project too much for a capstone project).
cora extension is the NVDLA extension designed from soDLA, using the similar design method, focus on L4-L5 autonomous driving system in control, localization, and trajectory generation. cora is not open-source project. 

In Oct 2020, with the cora extension project, NProcessor is selected as hotdesk team in [berkeley skydeck](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/). We got much aws credit and google credit to support soDLA and cora project together now. 

## Testing, Verification and Integrations

Although [chisel-uvm](https://github.com/chisel-uvm) is under development with the lead of Martin Schoeberl, uvm in chisel still need some time to mature. Currently, soDLA need to be fully tested on [firesim-nvdla](https://github.com/CSL-KU/firesim-nvdla). Welcome to test soDLA on firesim(send an email to me yuda@berkeley.edu), since we have the free aws credit. 

Current Milestone:

## Why soDLA Docs

IC designers are painters, not workers.

soDLA-docs allow individual developers to design NVDLA-like customized hardware accelerators.
